"We've heard enough of what it takes to excel on the basketball field. It takes persistence and grit, perseverance, discipline and grit to be accepted."
- Coach Wooden on his time with the Boston Celtics.
"The real challenge is not in the preparation, but the discipline. The ultimate prize is in doing what is right, believing what you are told, and pushing yourself harder."
- Joe Namath
"An athletic life is an endurance of work. A life dedicated to fitness is a fitness that lasts as long as the work."
- Greg Glassman
There is a world of distinction between the technical excellence of basketball and the endurance of living a life dedicated to fitness. The distinction is one that should rightfully be defended as one that has been developed to match the intensity of the sport.
The distinction needs to be made, not simply to be ignored.
