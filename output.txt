"Fight Gone Bad!"
This is our famous “Fight Gone Bad” workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We've used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are:
Wall-ball - 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)
Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps)
Box Jump - 20” box (Reps)
Push-press 75 pounds (Reps)
Row - calories (Calories)
The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of “rotate”, the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.
Add your points and post them to comments. 405 is the score to beat.
